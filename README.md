# Digital-Bones-Box
Digital Bones Box aims to provide an open-source platform to generate and display 3D models of bones and joints. These models will be used by physiotherapists to explain diagnoses and treatment plans to patients.


Core Features
3D Model Viewer: Display detailed 3D models of human bones.
Annotations and Notes: Allow physiotherapists to add annotations and notes to specific parts of the model.
Interactive Features: Enable rotation, zoom, and pan to explore models from different angles.
Integration with Medical Data: Interface to upload and overlay medical images (like X-rays) onto the 3D models.
Patient Management: Maintain a database of patient records and associated 3D models.
Cross-Platform: Ensure the application runs smoothly on both Android and iOS devices.


Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native
3D Rendering
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
