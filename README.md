**Digital Bone Box App**

**Overview**
The Digital Bone Box App is an educational application designed for students to study the bones of the human body. This project aims to convert a pre-existing educational tool built in PowerPoint into an interactive, user-friendly mobile app.

**Project Vision**

**Transforming an Educational Tool:** Convert the Digital Bone Box, which includes real photos of bones with overlays and detailed descriptions, into a mobile application.
**Enhancing Student Learning:** Provide students with an engaging and interactive way to study anatomy compared to traditional methods.

**Existing Tool and Conversion**

**From PowerPoint to Interactive App:** The current Digital Bone Box is a PowerPoint presentation with educational content. This project will transform it into a mobile app that students can easily use on their devices.
**Features of the Pre-existing Digital Bone Box:** Includes real photos of bones, overlays, and detailed descriptions to aid in the study of human anatomy.

**Research and Development**

**Assessing Educational Effectiveness:** Research outcomes will evaluate the app's effectiveness compared to traditional study methods.
**Pedagogical Research Outcomes:** Further research will explore various educational benefits and pedagogical impacts of using the app.

**Platform and Accessibility**

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The app will be available on multiple mobile platforms, including iOS and Android.
**Free and Paid Versions:** A free version of the app will be available to all users, with a paid version offering additional features. Revenue from the paid version will fund future maintenance and development.

**Collaborative Efforts**

**University Department Collaboration:** This project will be a collaborative effort between various departments at the university.
**Software Development:** Led by the Computer Science department.
**User Interface and Design:** Supported by the Studio Art program.

**Future Maintenance and Development**
