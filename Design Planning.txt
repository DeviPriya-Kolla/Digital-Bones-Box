# Project Planning:

## Requirement Gathering and Analysis:

Schedule a meeting with the client to discuss the detailed requirements for the Digital Bone Box mobile app.
Gather information about the specific features, content, and user expectations.
Document the requirements and get them approved by the client.


## Technology Selection:

For the frontend, we have decided to use React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
For the backend, we have decided to use Python Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework.


## Project Kickoff and Skeleton Development:

Set up the development environment, including the necessary tools and libraries for React and Python Flask.
Create the initial project structure and directory layout.
Implement the basic app navigation and routing using React Router.
Set up the Flask server and define the initial API endpoints.
Establish the data models and schema for users, bones, and quiz content.
Implement the user authentication and registration functionality using Flask-Login or a similar library.


## 3D Bone Model Integration:

Research and evaluate 3D rendering libraries compatible with React Native, such as Three.js or Babylon.js.
Integrate the selected 3D rendering library and create the initial 3D bone models.
Implement the interactive features for the 3D bone models, such as zooming, rotating, and labeling.


## Bone Content Migration:

Migrate the existing bone images, descriptions, and related data from the PowerPoint tool.
Integrate the bone content into the app's data models and user interface.


## Quiz and Progress Tracking:

Design the quiz functionality, including question formats, scoring, and feedback mechanisms.
Implement the progress tracking system to store and retrieve user performance data.
Integrate the quiz and progress tracking features into the app.


## Bookmarking and Note-taking:

Develop the bookmarking feature, allowing users to save important sections for later reference.
Implement the note-taking functionality, enabling users to add their own annotations.


## Testing and Refinement:

Set up the testing framework, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
Conduct thorough testing to ensure the app's stability, performance, and adherence to requirements.
Gather user feedback and incorporate necessary refinements and improvements.


## Deployment and Maintenance:

Package the app for deployment on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
Implement a continuous deployment pipeline to facilitate future updates and bug fixes.
Establish a maintenance and support plan, including regular updates, user feedback collection, and performance monitoring.
